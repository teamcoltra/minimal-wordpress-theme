# excid3.com Wordpress Theme

This is my blog's wordpress theme that I've modified from the Minimal
Guy theme by Guy Ro.

The original website and theme seem to be unavailable on the internet so
I'm hosting my modified version here. The original theme description is
as follows:

    Theme Name: Minimal Guy
    Theme URI: http://guyro.com/minimal-wordpress-theme/
    Description: A very clean minimalist theme, search, archives or other features.
    Author: Guy Ro
    Author URI: http://guyro.com
    Tags: white, two-columns, fixed-width
    Version: 1.0
    .
    This theme is uncopyrighted, free, and offered as is.

## Installation

As simple as creating a folder in your wp-content/themes directory
called "minimal-guy" and copying the files there via FTP.

Alternatively if you have git on your server you can ssh in, navigate to
the themes directory and clone the repository:

    cd /WORDPRESS DIRECTORY/wp-content/themes
    git clone git://github.com:excid3/excid3-wordpress-theme.git minimal-guy
